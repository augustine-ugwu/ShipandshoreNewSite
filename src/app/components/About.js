            <p className="text-base text-justify mb-6">
              Ship & Shore Services Limited has been very active and a major
              player in the Nigerian Shipping/Oil & Gas industry. Following the
              need for transportation of petroleum products by the Nigerian
              National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) in the early 1990, the
              company was one of the pioneer that supplied the NNPC coastal
              vessel on charter for the transportation of refined petroleum
              products AGO, LPFO and PMS from the refineries at Portharcourt and
              Warri and also lightering import vessels through Ship to Ship
              (STS) transfer and discharge at storage facilities in the Lagos
              area. Over the years- 35 years, the company has had the privilege
              of providing vessels and tugboats to the Nigerian National
              Petroleum Corporation (NNPC). Ship & Shore Services Limited based
              on her pedigree, technical and professional experience in
              bunkering and vessel chartering/operations has been privileged to
              charter vessels as well as the only company awarded a bunkering
              contract of supplying NNPC vessels consistently for over 20 years.
